Hello

Welcome to my futuristic pong game I created with the help of Cursor AI.

Leveraging the pygame template as a starting point, I prompted Cursor to create me a simple Pong game and then followed up with adding features like the scoreboard, stylistic changes, and tweaked a few game dynamics.

AI tools are becoming increasingly powerful and I believe it is important toget hands on experience using the tools to build things that could potentially end up as much larger projects.

How we communicate to these tools continues to be the art of the industry but Cursor AI has showed me a ton of promise. Stay tuned for additional simple arcade games on my repo - I'll be building out a full library as a starting point to future ventures!
